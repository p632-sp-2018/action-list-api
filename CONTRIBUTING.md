# How to contribute

## We Develop with Github
We use github as our version control system to host code, to track issues and to monitor requests, as well as  to accept pull requests.

## Setup

### Clone the Project Repository from Github
Before you do anything else, login/signup on GitHub and head to the [Project Repository on Github](https://github.com/p632-sp-2018/action-list-api).  Have a look at the repository and for any further information head to README.md or wiki sections.

Now, to clone the git repo use the following command-line argument
```
git clone https://github.com/p632-sp-2018/action-list-api.git
```
To set the development environment up and running go through the [Environment Setup Guide](https://github.com/p632-sp-2018/action-list-api/wiki/Environment-Setup)


## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
As we use Github Flow all the code changes occur through Pull Requests. Submitting code changes through Pull Requests is one of the most common mechanism  followed in the industry.  To contribute to this project this is the procedure that needs to be followed.
1. Clone the repo as mentioned above
2. Branch off from master by creating a branch pertaining to a particular [issue on github](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
3. To create an issue on github, follow this [guide](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).
4. Add test cases to the code changes you are making if any and also update the corresponding documentation
5. Travis CI is enabled on a push to even feature branches and make sure that the build passes before issuing a pull request.
6. Also make sure the quality of the code is maintained and coding conventions are followed.
7. Issue the pull request and follow this guide - [How to Issue a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
8. At least one of the developers will review the code and merge it onto the master if  it is fine and there no issues.


## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* For indentation we used tabs
